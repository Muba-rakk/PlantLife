# PlantLife
PlantLife is a text-based app that lets you simulate caring for virtual plants. It was built with the C++ programming language and designed to fulfill a final semester exam assignment. You can use it to maintain plant health by adjusting things like water content, fertilizer, and light exposure, while applying basic programming concepts you've learned in lectures.
